# Early Stage Diabetes Project 
Welcome to my machine learning related projects!

1. This project was completed in requirement to complete "Introduction to Data Analytics" course at York University, with the collaboration of other 2 team members @Nathan, @Shehnaz.

2. Performed data characterization, data visualization, explorative analysis to come up with following hypotheses:
- Patient group aged from 39 to 45 has the most number of diabete cases. Risk is extremely high for patient above 70.
- Women is more likely to get diabetes than men even though the number of men and women are equal.
- Patients who experienced symptoms such as frequent urination, sudden weight loss, extreme thrist, Weakness are more likely to be diabetic.

3. Used Binary Encoding to process binary categorial variables into indicator variable,and Data Binning to process numerical variable.

4. Used Pythonâ€™s Scikit-learn library to develop classification model using KNN, Decision Tree, and Ada Boost Algorithms to form general hypothesis about the training data set, and use another data set to evaluate model performance.

5. Performed 4 different experiements by modifying training data set to pick out the model with highest accuracy has out final model. Metrics (accuracy, error rate, and AUC) were used to evaluate model performance. Our goal is to minimize the number of False Negative to ensure preventative measures are taken to stop the disease getting worse.

6. Future work:
 + Obtaining more training data to ensure the model robustness.
 + More data should be collected to ensure accurate diagnose.
